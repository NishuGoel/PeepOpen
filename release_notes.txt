h1. <span>2010-04-16</span> Release 0.1.9

h2. Coda, MacVim, Caching, Default Sort

* MacVim opens files as drag-and-drop. You may need to change your MacVim preferences to "Open files from applications in the current window and set the arglist."
* Panic's Coda editor is now supported.
* Default sorting works more like TextMate. The previously opened file is at the top, making it possible to switch between two files without searching.
* The list of project files is cached in memory. A future update will expire the cache when files on disk are updated.
