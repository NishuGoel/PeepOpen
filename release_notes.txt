h1. <span>2010-06-07</span> Release 0.2.1

h2. Custom Ignores, Background Refresh, Progress Bar, Native TextMate helper plugin

* Directory and file ignore patterns are configurable in the Advanced Preference pane.
* Files are loaded in a background thread (with a progress bar) for speed. Future updates will use this to refresh file metadata more intelligently.
* The progress bar uses Core Animation (and will trigger the Nvidia card in the newer MacBook Pro) but it can be disabled in the Advanced Preference pane. Or, force your machine to use a specific graphics chip with "gfxCardStatus":http://codykrieger.com/gfxCardStatus/.
* Copying, cutting, pasting, and selecting in the search field is now possible.
* Native TextMate helper plugin activates PeepOpen even with no individual project files open (but a project must be open). Re-install the plugin from the Preferences pane.
* The preferences window no longer closes after installing the plugin.
* Experimental Xcode support (see the Help docs).
* Better build system with Choctop used inside the Xcode build.
* Various bugfixes.


h1. <span>2010-05-11</span> Release 0.2.0

h2. Menu Bar App, Manual File Reloading

* The app is now a menu bar item and won't show up in the dock or app switcher.
* Command-R refreshes the cached list of files for a single project (use when switching git branches or after generating new files for your app).
* New icon! By the talented Eddie Wilson, http://eddit.com
* Refreshing while searching retains the search term and inserts new files with search applied.
* UI polishing.
* Source of BWToolkit and Sparkle are now stored in local Vendor directory for self-contained building.
* Re-implemented preferences as a legitimate toolbar-driven window.
* Added preference to NOT show Git metadata. This will be faster on some older machines.
* Added preference to run Git diff against current files (not yet in the index) or HEAD (last commit). Running against HEAD may be slower on older machines.
* Extracted graphical window layouts to separate Nib files. May launch faster in some cases.

h1. <span>2010-04-21</span> Release 0.1.9

h2. UI, Help Docs, MacVim, Caching, Default Sort, Coda

* The Help menu now features functional help documentation.
* MacVim files are now opened with "open -a MacVim filename". You will need to change your MacVim preferences to "Open files from applications in the current window and set the arglist."
* Panic's Coda editor is now supported.
* Default sorting works more like TextMate. The previously opened file is at the top, making it possible to switch between two files without searching.
* The list of project files is cached in memory. A future update will expire the cache when files on disk are updated.
* File search is now depth-first and works more sensibly with deep directory structures.
